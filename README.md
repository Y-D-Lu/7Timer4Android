## Overview

>
[7Timer!](http://www.7timer.info/) is a series of web-based meteorological forecast products, mainly derived from the NOAA/NCEP-based numeric weather model, the Global Forecast System (GFS). 7Timer! was firstly established in July 2005 as an exploration product under supported of the National Astronomical Observatories of China and had been largely renovated in 2008 and 2011. Currently it is supported by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory of Chinese Academy of Sciences. It was firstly designed as a weather forecast tool for astronomical purpose, as the author himself is a long-term star gazer and was always annoyed by fluky weather conditions.

However, the [7Timer!](http://www.7timer.info/) gets coordinates for forecast from the __Google Map__ API, which is rarely accessable in China mainland.

In this project, we use __Baidu Map__ APIs to get coordinates we need to get forecast from [7Timer!](http://www.7timer.info/) on Android devices without proxy.
